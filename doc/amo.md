## Control your browser with your keyboard *only*.

Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on VIM.
Most common tasks you want your browser to perform are bind to a single key
press:

You want to open a new tab? Hit `t`.
You want to follow that link? Hit `f` and type the displayed label.
You want to go to the bottom of the page? Hit `G`. Or the top? `gg`.
You want to focus the text field on Wikipedia to search for another term? `gi`.
Switch to the next tab? `gt`.
Go back in time? `H`.
Notice that this tab is rubbish and you want to close it? `d`.
Regret that decision? `u` restores it.
Temporarily disable all that magic because you can't stand it? `I`.
But how do you use your browser now? `Shift-Esc` and we're back on.

The list could go on a bit here, but I guess you'll get the point. If you feel
lost sometimes `:help` might help you a lot.

**Highlighted features:**

 - follow any link on the site with just 2-3 key presses.
 - switch to any open tab by searching for its URL or title or entering its ID.
 - easy customizable search settings
 - bind any supported command or commands to the key (sequence) of your liking
 - great default bindings (if you're used to Pentadactyl or Vimperator)

This add-on is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend
to implement the majority of Vimperator's features.

We recommend that you use the beta versions below.
